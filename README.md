# Thesis Project - Representation Learning and Predicitive Maintenance of Vehicles

## Abstract (from Paper)
Automobile Predictive Maintenance (PdM) necessitates the storage and analysis of large amounts ofsensor data, a requirement can be challenging in deploying PdM algorithms onboard the vehiclesdue to limited storage and computational power on the hardware of the vehicle. 
Hence, this project seek to obtain low dimensional descriptive features from high dimensional data using Representation Learning. The low dimensional representation can now be used for predicting vehicle faults, specifically Turbocharger related failures in this project.
A Parallel Stacked Autoencoder based architecture is presented with the aim of producing better representations when compared to individual serial Autoencoders. Also, Embeddings are employed on Categorical Variables to improve the performance of the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) models by introducing continuity into the data. 
This architecture is shown to achieve excellent performance, and in close standards to the previous state-of-the-art research. Significant improvement in Turbocharger failure prediction is obtained along with reduction insize of input data using our novel deep learning ANN architecture

## Repository Structure
This repository contains the codes, models, files and every related content during the course of the project development. For privacy and NDA reasons, the original data used for this project has been removed. A sample data has been provided though after our data engineering proposes.

The repository is structured in a self explanatory folder structure, with each folder name explaining what its contents does as much as possible.
